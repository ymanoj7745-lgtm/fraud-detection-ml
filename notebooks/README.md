# Notebooks

This folder contains exploratory notebooks used during development:

- `01_eda.ipynb` – exploratory data analysis
- `ml_pipeline.ipynb` – advanced modeling pipeline experimentation (feature engineering + SMOTE + RandomForest)
- `main.ipynb` – additional experiments / scratch work

Notebooks are not required to run the Streamlit app or to train the model via `train_model.py`.
